## UX Study for the Drupal Admin UI

- Intersection of User & Business Goals
  - Need to ask questions to find common ground between business goals and what users want
- What are Business Goals?
  - Convince evaluators to **select** Drupal
  - Help orgs **adopt** Drupal
  - Provide a great tool for managing **structured content**
  - Provide a great tool for creating flexible, **marketing content**
  - Provide a great tool for building powerful **functionality**
  - Provide a way to use Drupal as a **content hub**
- What are users' goals?
  - That depends. There are so many types of users:
    - Who are we building for?
    - What do we want the users to do?
    - What do we know about the users?
  - Examples:
    - Evaluators
    - Content Editors
    - Site Admins
    - Developers
- Let's focus on content editors\*
  - What do content editors want?
    - Be able to find content
    - quickly write content
  - Content editor experience has overlapped with site admin experience
- Research Techniques
  - Survey
    - What is your role?
    - tasks performed?
    - what do you like?
    - what is challenging?
    - what do you think could be improved?
  - Results
    - modern UI
    - Simplifying the complexity of UI
    - better media management
    - WYSIWYG improvements
- Comparitive Usability testing - part 1
  - User testing - competitors - setup
    - Script:
      - what do you think of the UI
      - Create article
      - Create links
      - Publish article
    - Contentful
      - NO WYSIWYG
      - Markdown editor
      - Labels were really important (didn't make sense)
    - Craft CMS
      - UI with little buttons (similar to paragraphs in D8)
    - WordPress
      - Gutenberg (has an instant preview)
      - Can be limiting, preview doesn't look same as frontend
    - SquareSpace
      - Has simple plus button at bottom
      - Too small, not labelled, CE didn't find
      - Labels are important
  - User testing - competitors - preview
    - Side-by-side preview was very popular
    - Publication workflow was difficult, CE were worried about losing content
    - Users love autosave
  - User Testing - competitors - takeaways
    - Complexity should be commensurate with the task
    - Editors like a CE-friendly welcome page, terminology, language
    - Editors want to be able to see/edit HTML
    - Editors want to know/change state of content
  - Solutions/Short term improvements
    - Create role for Content Editors
    - Autosave
    - Content Editor Role
