## Devsigners

- Chimera of the web

  - "Wait, you know how to do that?"
  - Probably works as a developer
    - Knows what a PR is
    - Invited to meetings to help "translate"
    - Probably a part of the dev or maybe UX team
  - ## Might have the soul of a designer
  - Struggles to find the right fit

  ## Unicorns

  - "I dunno, go ask the unicorn"
  - People want to talk the unicorn
    - Has at least 20 unread pings
    - Speaks for the team around most technical descisions
  - Things just work out when they're around
    - Hey this thing will take you 5 mins but it would tak em an hour
    - One of the fe people you can get to
  - They're hard to find and hard to keep
  - Really powerful for an organization
    - not just good at their job, force multipliers
    - businesses rely on them

## Hero culture

- Valuable people are hard to find, become unhealthy focus
- Cultivates addiction
  - Creates feeback loop and sense of being special
- Hides real problems
  - Reliance on unicorns means something sbroken
- Hero culture doesn't scale
  - Often makes others feel un-empowered
- Nurtures dependency
  - Hero culture is vicious cycle of dependency
  - Nurtures a culture that rewards them for having information

## Being a hero has a darkside

- Eventually unanticipated extra commitments lead to burnout and dissatisfaction
  - excessive workloads create stress
  - peple rarely join to fight fires
  - job security is substitute
  - real progress becomes byproduct, not goal
  - self worth is derived from fixing things (instead of innovation)

## Dependency is a massive organizational problem

- Orgs become dependent on a hadful of heroes and push them toward generalization
- If can't explore and learn in chosen discipline, you fall behind
- If a business is dependent on just a few key people, it will struggle to scale and manage risk

## Heroes don't last

- Hero culture sucks the life out of the best people
  - This feeds imposter syndrome (heroes feel that they will eventually get 'found out')
  - You spend yourself solving other people's problems (the art of busy)
  - Exploration and mastery becomes secondary
  - People will ship 100 tickets, but the most important gets saved for last

## How do we fight this?

### Better Processes

- If work gets added, something gets removed
- Deditcate time to mentorship and coaching
- Build a successufl delivery model and use if for almost everything
- Track risks and work to mitigate them (person who doesn't take vacation, is always frantic/stressed out)
- Have awesome info sharing integrated into workflow
- Build meaningful metrics for success

### Better Rewards

- A bad reward system is worse than no reward system
  - Reward systems are incredibly difficult to get right and they take time
  - Reward systems are often informal (you probably have one even if you think you dont)
  - Dont make the rewards trivial but also don't make them feel like a necessity
  - Tout team rewards but keep individual rewards personal and private
  - Look at how much rewards shape behavior and be willing to cull or iterate
- Reward people in private so you aren't making everyone else feel bad for not getting it. If they want to talk about it with coworkers thats fine, but don't put one person on pedestal.
- Talk to employees and ask about rewards and what they like and don't like.

### Better Tech

- We have tooling that helps relieve pressure
- Meet people where they already work, reduce repetition, look for things that can be replaced without major disruption
- We review tools every quarter focusing on **satisfaction** and **adoption**
- Replaced tools every wuarter: Jira / Confluence / Trello / Basecamp / Google Docs, hangouts, Xero
  - **Current tools:**
  - Notion
  - Workast
  - Zoom
  - Slack
  - Harvest
  - iCloud
  - GitHub

### Build Empathy

- Change idea of what positive contrib means
- Dont fall into traps
  - this isn't just 9-5
  - like a family
  - only one that can't get this done
  - get great exposure and experience
- represent the value of mentorship and help distinctly
- Make a business case for exploration and learning
- At agencies, **enable people to create initiatives that you treat like projects** with a scope, timleine, budget, forecasting, and resourcing
- At product companies, factor in risk as an **additional development cost**

### Self Determination

- Be willing to understand your own value and fight for it
  - Keep your curiosity and spend at least some time focusted on exploration of new ideas
  - Find places where you have autonomy and personalize your ownership of them
  - Look for opportunities to collaborate and share knowledge with team

### Redefine Success

- Understand how your values are shared
  - Be mindful of the impact decisions have had on org and associated risk
  - Keep and encourage a reasonable pace
  - Support members of your team by sharing info, mentoring, and collab

## Book Recommendations

- A hero behind every tree (approachable)
- Smart leaders smart teams
- Group Dynamics for teams (dense)
